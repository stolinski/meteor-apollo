## [1.0.0] - 2017-07-27

### Added
- Add support for an asynchronous context [#105](https://github.com/apollographql/meteor-integration/pull/105)

## [0.9.1] - 2017-05-27
### Changed
- Fix [#101](https://github.com/apollographql/core-docs/issues/101): return an empty object from `getUserContext` when nobody is authenticated.
- Fixes lint issue on `package.js` (from previous version)
- Automatic update of `.version` from latest Meteor version.

## [0.9.0] - 2017-05-27
### Changed
- Allow `context` option to be a function that accepts context with the current user, and returns final context.

## [0.8.0] - 2017-05-16
### Changed
- Remove NPM warnings: just make it fail early if you don't have dependencies installed.

## [0.7.2] - 2017-03-30
### Changed
- Invite the package's users to install `apollo-client@1.0.0`!

## [0.7.1] - 2017-03-30
### Changed
- Update dependencies: `apollo-client@1.0.0-rc.9` & `graphql-tools@0.11.0`

## [0.7.0] - 2017-03-22
### Changed
- No more `dataIdFromObject` pre-configuration: `apollo-client` does it for us.
- Fix accounts client-side: the login token is handled per request and not per client, by looking for it directly in the middleware.
- Fix options server-side (issue [#90](https://github.com/apollographql/core-docs/issues/90)).

# Removed
- Breaking: Subscriptions configuration are not any more handled in this package: this package is intended to *provide easy configuration of an Apollo client and its network interface to communicate with a GraphQL Express Server*. A new package is going to be created to configure GraphQL subscriptions in a Meteor context.

## [0.6.1] - 2017-03-18
### Changed
- Depends on latest `apollo-client`: version 1.0.0-rc.3. Also update `graphql-subscriptions` (note: dependency on this latter package should be removed on next release, see [discussion](https://github.com/apollographql/core-docs/pull/260)).

## [0.6.0] - 2017-03-16
### Changed
- Move logic code to `/src`.
- Use `rawCollection` method on `Meteor.users` for the current user lookup, to allow the tests to pass (also no need to wrap the GraphQL server in `Meteor.bindEnvironment` as it no more a Fibers-aware code). 

### Added
- Set up ESLint with prettier & Meteor settings.
- Provide `handleDone` utility for asynchronous tests which to catch errors.
- Handle GraphQL subscriptions client-side with the option `enableSubscriptions` on `createMeteorNetworkInterface` & start a websocket server if a `pubsub` mechanism is passed along the `schema` to `createApolloServer`.

## [0.5.0] - 2017-03-03
### Changed
- Breaking: Use latest NPM dependencies, especially `apollo-cient@1.0.0-rc.0`.
- Provide a middleware handling (`apply(Batch)Middleware`), related to  `apollo-client@1.0.0-rc.0`.
- In tests, use `print` from `graphql` itself and not from `graphql-tag`, related to `graphql-tag@1.3` & upcoming `graphql-tag@2.0`.


## [0.4.1] - 2017-02-27
### Changed
- Pass `batchingInterval` to the batching network interface if configured to used it in `createMeteorNetworkInterface`.
- Move `networkInterface` configuration with `createMeteorNetworkInterface()` from the `defaultClientConfig` to the `meteorClientConfig` function, so that it's only executed when needed and not on startup too...

## [0.4.0] - 2017-02-26
### Changed

- The argument to `meteorClientConfig()` was changed: `meteorClientConfig(networkInterfaceConfig)` -> `meteorClientConfig(customClientConfig)`. If you previously did `meteorClientConfig({ batchingInterface: false })`, it should be changed to:
- Don't force `meteor/apollo` to update their NPM dependencies on Graphql-related packages, clean-up the User Accounts middleware [#74](https://github.com/apollographql/meteor-integration/pull/74)

```js
meteorClientConfig({
  networkInterface: createMeteorNetworkInterface({ batchingInterface: false })
});
```

### Added

-  Make it possible to extend the default Apollo Client & network interface configuration objects with any Apollo Client & interface options (+ some tests) [#70](https://github.com/apollographql/meteor-integration/pull/70)


- Don't force `meteor/apollo` to update their NPM dependencies on Graphql-related packages, clean-up the User Accounts middleware [#74](https://github.com/apollographql/meteor-integration/pull/74)
